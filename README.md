# modular-pytorch-lightning⚡️
[WIP] modular-pytorch-lightning, **WARNING: The repository is currently under development, and is unstable.**

If you are interested in participating, please contact `sieunpark77@gmail.com`!!!

What is `Modular-pytorch-Lightning⚡️`(MLight) for?
- MLight is based on `pytorch-lightning` and aims at supporting many popular subtasks and training procedures in Computer Vision and potentially other fields.
- One of the designing principles of `modular-pytorch-lightning` is to make it convinient to use every component(function and classes) outside the repo. To achive this, I avoided making any un-essential dependancies on most of the code, by avoiding too much abstraction and subclassing in particular.

I felt that the design of `pytorch-lightning` is very effective in this terms.

This repository is designed to utilize many amazing and robust and open-source projects such as `timm`, `pytorch`, and more. 

Notes(rules) for development
- The development of this repo should stick towards the [PEP](https://peps.python.org/)(Python Enhancement Proposals) conventions and `flake8` linting.
- Function or class docstrings must follow Numpy [style guidelines](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
- The performance of every implementation has to be validated before being merged into `main`. The results and config used to reproduce the results should be presented in the relevant `README.MD` file.

[WIP] awesome-modular-pytorch-lightning

What is `Awesome-Modular-pytorch-Lightning`(AML) for?
- AML is a repo based on `pytorch-lightning`, which currently supports a number of popular subtasks and training procedures in Computer Vision. I hope people can use use this repo to easily experiment their ideas on the most modern training procudures for a fair comparison.
- While designing this repo, I really wanted to make it convinient so that every component(function and classes) of the repo could easily be copied and used in another repo and run standalone. To achive this, I try to avoid making dependancies on ANY of the code, by avoiding the use interface classes and subclassing.

Deep learning is great, but there are many implementation details hidden in the code. Also, some repos are too complicated 
or abstract to be able to actually look at the implementation of algorithms. Using 

Notes(rules) for development
- The development of this repo should stick towards the [PEP](https://peps.python.org/)(Python Enhancement Proposals) conventions and `flake8` linting.
- Function or class docstrings must follow Numpy [style guidelines](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
- The performance of every implementation has to be validated before being merged into `main`. The results and config used to reproduce the results should be presented in the relevant `README.MD` file.
